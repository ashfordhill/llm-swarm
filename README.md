# LLM Swarm: Multi-Agent Code Generation System

**Status: 🚀 Production Ready - Advanced AI Project Generator**

A multi-agent system that generates complete, working full-stack applications from high-level prompts. Uses specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, Database) to create real code with proper framework syntax and project structure.

**Future Vision**: Repository-specific LoRA adapters for true codebase specialization.

## 🎯 **What LLM Swarm Does Right Now**

**Current AI coding tools are limited because:**
- They generate single files, not complete applications
- They mix framework syntaxes (Vue code in React projects)
- They can't coordinate multiple aspects (frontend + backend + database)
- They lose context in complex, multi-file projects

**LLM Swarm's Current Solution:**
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized Frontend, Backend, and Database agents
- **🎯 Framework Intelligence**: Generates correct React/Vue/Angular syntax
- **📦 Complete Applications**: Full-stack projects with proper file structure
- **🔄 Intelligent Orchestration**: Breaks complex projects into manageable chunks
- **✅ Real Code Generation**: Working applications, not just placeholders

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture: Multi-Agent Code Generation**

### **🤖 Specialized Agent System**
LLM Swarm uses specialized agents that understand different aspects of software development:

- **🎨 Frontend Agent**: Expert in React, Vue, Angular with proper syntax and patterns
- **⚙️ Backend Agent**: Specializes in Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, API development
- **🗄️ Database Agent**: Handles MongoDB, PostgreSQL schemas, models, and queries
- **🧪 Testing Agent**: Creates comprehensive test suites (planned)
- **📚 Documentation Agent**: Generates project documentation (planned)

### **🎯 Intelligent Task Orchestration**
- **Project Designer**: Breaks high-level prompts into detailed technical specifications
- **Work Chunking**: Divides complex projects into manageable, agent-specific tasks
- **Context Passing**: Ensures agents have proper framework and tech stack information
- **Execution Coordination**: Routes chunks to appropriate specialized agents

### **🔮 Future Vision: Repository-Specific LoRA Specialization**
*The long-term roadmap includes training custom adapters on your specific codebase:*

- **Repository Analysis**: Understand your existing code patterns and architecture
- **Custom LoRA Training**: Create adapters specialized for your Redux patterns, API conventions, etc.
- **Domain-Specific Minions**: Agents trained on Spring Boot, specific testing frameworks, etc.
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapters that improve as your codebase evolves

## 🚀 **Quick Start** (Working System)

```

## 🧪 **Technical Deep Dive: How Multi-Agent Generation Works**

### **Current System: Enhanced Context Passing**
```python
# Traditional AI tools: Generic model with minimal context
response = gpt4("You are a React developer. Write a component for user login.")
# Result: Generic React component, might use wrong framework syntax

# LLM Swarm Current: Multi-agent with enhanced context
frontend_agent = FrontendAgent(config)
context = {
    "tech_stack": {"frontend": ["React"], "backend": ["Express"]},
    "framework_context": {
        "primary_frameworks": {"frontend": "React"},
        "specific_instructions": ["Use JSX syntax, not Vue template syntax"],
        "code_examples": {"react_component": "import React, { useState }..."}
    }
}
response = frontend_agent.execute_task(task, context)
# Result: Proper React component with correct syntax and patterns
```

### **Future Vision: Repository-Specific LoRA Specialization**
```python
# Future LLM Swarm: Repository-specific + domain-specific context
redux_minion = base_model.load_adapters([
    "generic_react.lora",           # Knows React patterns
    "your_repo_redux.lora",         # Knows YOUR Redux patterns
    "your_repo_auth.lora"           # Knows YOUR auth patterns
])
response = redux_minion("""
Create a login component that follows our existing patterns.
Context: {your_existing_auth_components}
""")
# Result: Component that matches your exact coding style and architecture
```

### **Current Multi-Agent System**
```yaml
# Current Agent Specialization (using enhanced prompts)
current_agents:
  frontend_agent: 
    specializes_in: ["React", "Vue", "Angular", "HTML/CSS", "JavaScript/TypeScript"]
    context_aware: "Receives tech stack and framework-specific instructions"
  backend_agent:
    specializes_in: ["Node.js/Express", "Python/FastAPI", "REST APIs", "Authentication"]
    context_aware: "Understands project architecture and database requirements"
  database_agent:
    specializes_in: ["MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "Schema design", "Models"]
    context_aware: "Knows backend framework and data requirements"

# Future Multi-Level Adapter System (Planned)
future_generic_adapters:
  react_patterns: "Understands React hooks, components, JSX"
  spring_boot: "Knows @RestController, @Service, @Repository patterns"
  postgresql: "Expert in SQL, indexing, query optimization"

future_repo_specific_adapters:
  your_redux_patterns: "Your specific action creators, reducer patterns"
  your_api_conventions: "Your error handling, response formats"
  your_component_library: "Your custom components, styling patterns"
```

### **Current Context System vs Future Pipeline**

**Current Context Creation:**
```python
# Current: Enhanced prompt-based context
def create_framework_context(tech_stack):
    context = {
        "primary_frameworks": detect_primary_frameworks(tech_stack),
        "specific_instructions": generate_framework_instructions(tech_stack),
        "code_examples": get_framework_examples(tech_stack)
    }
    return context

# Agents receive rich context but use standard OpenAI models
agent.execute_task(task, enhanced_context)
```

**Future Repository Analysis Pipeline:**
```python
# Future: Repository-specific LoRA training
analyzer = RepositoryAnalyzer()
contexts = analyzer.analyze_repo("/path/to/your/repo")

# Discovered contexts might include:
contexts = {
    "redux_patterns": {
        "files": ["src/store/*.js", "src/actions/*.js"],
        "patterns": ["action creators", "reducers", "selectors"],
        "examples": 247  # code examples found
    }
}

# Train custom adapters
for context_name, context_info in contexts.items():
    dataset = generate_training_data(context_info)
    adapter = train_lora_adapter(dataset, base_model="codellama-7b")
    save_adapter(adapter, f"{context_name}.lora")
```
